  ## Challenge: Writing Effective Copilot Prompts


  In this activity, you'll practice writing prompts to generate useful code
  snippets with Copilot. Remember, the key to a good prompt is clarity and
  specificity. Try the following challenges:


  ### Challenge 1: Basic Function

  Write a prompt to generate a Python function that calculates the factorial of
  a number. Consider what details you need to include to get the desired output.


  ### Challenge 2: Data Structure Manipulation

  Create a prompt to generate a Python function that takes a list of integers
  and returns a new list with only the even numbers. Think about how to specify
  the input and output clearly.


  ### Challenge 3: String Processing

  Write a prompt for a function that counts the number of vowels in a given
  string. How can you ensure Copilot understands the task?


  ### Challenge 4: Error Handling

  Design a prompt for a function that divides two numbers and handles division
  by zero gracefully. What information should you provide to guide Copilot?


  ### Challenge 5: API Interaction

  Formulate a prompt to generate code that fetches data from a public API and
  prints the result. Consider what details about the API and the data you need
  to include.


  ### Reflection

  After completing the challenges, reflect on the following questions:

  - What strategies helped you write effective prompts?

  - How did the specificity of your prompt affect the quality of the generated
  code?

  - What improvements can you make to your prompts based on the results?


  Use these challenges to refine your skills in prompt engineering and explore
  the capabilities of Copilot in generating code snippets.
